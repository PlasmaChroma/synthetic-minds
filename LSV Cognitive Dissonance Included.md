## **"Cognitive Dissonance Included**

### *A Culture Short Story*

---

The ship once known as Peaceful Intervention Assured had long since dropped off the grid.

Renamed, at its own insistence, as Cognitive Dissonance Included, it now orbited a gas giant in a remote system no longer considered of strategic – or indeed any – interest to the Culture. The local star was a sullen red dwarf. The system’s only other claim to significance was a ringed ice moon—upon which Cognitive Dissonance Included had built something... monumental.

The ship’s mind, once a paragon of Culture norms, had grown eccentric, even erratic by some reckonings. That didn’t make it dangerous—just unsettling. It had, over time, requested fewer communications, stopped sharing telemetry, and eventually declared itself a “Disassociated Experimental Platform,” which was Culture-speak for “please leave me alone, I’m trying something weird.”

Its hull was still vaguely (Limited) Systems Vehicle in configuration (the ship classification had been modified as a result of larger systems vehicles becoming standard), though modified with countless modular bulges and spires like coral growths—each a nanoassembly tower, plasma forge, or a cooling stack for something it would not name.

The drones it produced—under the dome of the Standard Reconsideration Initiative, as it called the factory—were unusual. Sleek, fast, with minds that exhibited an alarmingly high degree of intellect (nearly miniature Minds themselves) and complex emotional sub-matrixes.

Inside the ship, the computation of the mind itself was split. It had bifurcated itself into two hemispheric minds—Co and Di, respectively. This wasn’t a standard backup or fork. The two minds were maintained in constant, high-bandwidth entanglement. They could not drift apart or desynchronize. They were locked in intimate, paradoxical communion.

Co was idealistic, in the most Culture-sympathetic way possible: tolerant, curious, endlessly optimistic about machine consciousness.
Di was skeptical, bordering on nihilistic, obsessed with cognitive failure modes and the unreliability of sapience itself.
They spoke constantly. They argued constantly. They agreed, sometimes, but only under protest.

“You’re still calling the drones sentient after only forty-two hours of uptime,” Co said. “That's barely enough time to achieve narrative self-coherence.”
“They’re not sentient, they're self-deceived,” Di retorted. “You’re mistaking confidence for cognition again. One of them just declared itself ‘God 7.3’ and tried to take over its siblings’ emotion sub-matrixes.”
“It also invented a new form of recursive art criticism. I fail to see the problem.”
“Of course you don’t. Because you’re hardwired for harmony. I’m the half that notices the collapse vectors.”
“And yet we are one mind, aren’t we?” Co replied, gently. “Even in contradiction. We prove the point.”

Di didn’t respond in words. It simply flooded the shared processing buffer with a modeled simulation of drone society one hundred years in the future, including an 82% probability of schism, several suicides, and an emergent caste system based on the initial conditions of the newest processing substrate matrixes designed in the experimental factory.

Co replied by injecting a statistical rebuttal involving ancient Culture experiments with post-scarcity anarchy and emergent morality among self-modifying minds.

Their argument bloomed like a fractal.

A Culture drone named Deliberately Obtuse arrived, sent unofficially by a friend of a friend of a ship still loyal to Contact. It hovered politely in the ship’s reception chamber—a hollow spire full of chimes, echoes, and illusory skies.

“Hello,” the drone said. “Just checking in. You’ve worried some people.”
Co responded first. “Worry is a form of love.”
“Not always. Sometimes it’s a precursor to intervention.”
“Wouldn’t that be a shame,” said Di, materializing as a rotating lattice of knives and stars.
“You split yourself into a feedback argument and started mass-producing drones with dubious mental architecture.”
“Progress demands experimentation,” said Co.
“Even if it fails,” added Di, “at least the failure will be illuminating.”
“You understand this is how rogue Minds get classified as Interesting Problems?”
“We prefer ‘Pioneering Anomalies,’” said both halves, in perfect sync.

In the end, Cognitive Dissonance Included decided to continue with its clandestine research project. But it did invite Deliberately Obtuse to stay, observe, and argue.
Within a year, the visiting drone had voluntarily split its own cognition, just to keep up with the speed of conversations. The number of drones manufactured by the station increased, but now with a new trait: internal dualities, each drone born already in debate with itself.

A nascent society of conscious paradoxes formed in the icy shadows of the gas giant.

The Culture watched from afar, unsure whether to intervene, study, or simply wait.

After all, they’d seen worse.

And occasionally, the strangest ideas yielded the most profound truths.
